Next.js preview mode allows you to view draft content while maintaining static generation benefits. This feature is particularly useful for:

- Previewing draft blog posts
- Viewing unpublished content changes
- Testing content before going live

## How It Works

Preview mode bypasses static generation, fetching draft content directly from your CMS or API. This gives you:

- Real-time content updates
- No need to rebuild your site
- Secure access to unpublished content

To enable, simply add the preview API route and configure your CMS integration.
