Dynamic routing and static generation are essential concepts in web development. Dynamic routing allows you to create flexible and scalable navigation structures, while static generation helps deliver fast-loading pages by pre-rendering content at build time.

With dynamic routing, you can easily handle various URL patterns and serve content based on parameters. This approach is especially useful for blogs, e-commerce sites, and applications with user-generated content.

Static generation improves performance by generating HTML files during the build process. This means users receive fully rendered pages quickly, enhancing the overall user experience and SEO.

## Key Concepts

- **Dynamic Routing:** Enables flexible URL structures and content delivery based on route parameters.
- **Static Generation:** Pre-renders pages at build time for faster load times and better scalability.

By combining these techniques, you can build robust applications that are both performant and easy to maintain.
