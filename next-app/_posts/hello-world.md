Static Generation is Next.js's recommended pre-rendering method. Key advantages include:

- Blazing fast page loads
- Better SEO through pre-rendered content
- Reduced server load
- Automatic CDN caching

## Implementation

To use static generation:

1. Export `getStaticProps` for data fetching
2. Export `getStaticPaths` for dynamic routes
3. Build your application (`next build`)

The result is HTML generated at build time, ready to be served instantly to users.
